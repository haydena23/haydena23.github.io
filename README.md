# To do:

* Option to play artist top track in browser using Spotify widgets
* Make the site look good (CSS)
* Think of more stuff idk
* Description of the project in the README
* Search for an artist on the graph, zoom into it if found
* Button to hide all nodes but artist and their related nodes (Right click brings back hidden nodes, iterates for new nodes)
* Pick random color value, assign to a clicked node and their edges (Everything is grey right now, this differentiates artists and their connections)
* Add some sort of analytics
