# Musical Nodes
A Spotify Artist Exploration Website

Using the Spotify API and CytoScape.js,
this website constructs webs of related artists
depicted as Nodes

This website was a project for our CS 445 Networking class

## How To Explore:
1. Type in the name of an artist and hit Enter
2. Watch as the Nodes appear with the artist and all of their related artists
3. If you wish to learn more about an artist left click on their Node
4. If you wish to see an artist's related artists right click on their Node

# To do:

- [x] Option to play artist top track in browser using Spotify widgets
- [ ] Make the site look good (CSS)
- [ ] Think of more stuff idk
- [ ] Description of the project in the README
- [ ] Search for an artist on the graph, zoom into it if found
- [x] Button to hide all nodes but artist and their related nodes (Right click brings back hidden nodes, iterates for new nodes)
- [ ] Pick random color value, assign to a clicked node and their edges (Everything is grey right now, this differentiates artists and their connections)
- [ ] Add some sort of analytics
- [ ] Search for artist, pull list to select starting artist rather than automatically choosing first result
- [ ] Add better search bar/update layout of descriptions
- [ ] Add page to turn website into game like Wikipedia game. Given one artist, try to get to target artist in fewest clicks
